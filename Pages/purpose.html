	  <h4>Why did I make this Digital Portfolio?</h4>
    <p>I can show this to my future employers and colleagues to display what courses I’ve taken, the concepts I’ve learned, and how I have been able to apply them to this Digital Portfolio. My digital portfolio will grow with me while I reach for my future endeavors. This is the first time I have been able to display my progress in a form that adapts with me as I grow and I strive to make this the best dynamic display of myself on the internet. In the current state, my portfolio isnt a reflection of my best work but my current point in my journey as a student and a coder. This portfolio is also a way for me to experiment and learn through experience which will allow me to gain skills that can be applied in college and my career in the future.</p>
