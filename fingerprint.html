	<p>A Secure HTTPS connection aids in increased privacy because it protects from others viewing your personal information like passwords, credit card information, and purchasing data.</p>
	<p>The security is thanks to the advanced technology developed to employ unbreakable encryption for all connections. The issue with this new wave of privacy has created a loss of visibility</p>
	<p>forcing schools and organizations to find a new way to monitor and filter information. The response to this “loss of visibility” into every detail of students' and employees' internet usage</p>
	<p>is by developing new technology called “TTPS Proxy Appliances”. This technology gets around the guarantee of privacy that we once thought we had through an HTTPS connection.</p>
