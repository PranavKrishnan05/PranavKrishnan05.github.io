    <p> A Secure HTTPS connection aids in increased privacy because it protects from others viewing your personal information like passwords, credit card information, and purchasing data. The security is thanks to the advanced technology developed to employ unbreakable encryption for all connections.(<q>Gibson Reaserch Corporation</q>, 2020).One risk with using HTTP over https is a MITM attack also known as a man-in-the-middle attack. A MITM attack is where a perpetrator places themself between a user and an application to listen in or impersonate one of them. This puts your connection at risk and an HTTPS connection is a good way to prevent these attacks.One large issue caused by this new wave of privacy is that it has created a loss of visibility forcing schools and organizations to find a new way to monitor and filter information. The response to this <q>loss of visibility" into every detail of students' and employees' internet usage is by developing new technology called "HTTPS Proxy Appliance</q> which is essencialy putting the school in the middle of you and your aplication. This technology gets around the guarantee of privacy that we once thought we had through an HTTPS connection (<q>Man In The Middle</q>, n.d.).There is also a security risk formed when the school becomes the man in the middle, if the school doesn't have a secure connection it could allow for you to get hacked due to the school or organization's lack of security. This presents the question of if your school has the right to right to eavesdrop on your communications and saldy the answer to that question is yes. A school has the right to filter and mediate your internet usage if you are using a school owned device or on their network.</p>

    <p>Trusted websites have something called a Digital Certificate also known as a CA. A CA is a trusted entity that gives out SSL certificates. The Digital Certificates are used to cryptographically link an entity with a public key. These certificates also aid In authenticating content sent from web servers which provides trust in content online. This trust is benificial in ensuring safe transactions and communications. Looping back to the HTTPS Proxy Appliance I refered to before, this proxy apliance is also known as SSL Interception. This is where the HTTPS Proxy Appliance inspects and judges the user's content and it establishes a another secure connection to the web server. The proxy impersonates the user and logs all the data. After that the data is re-encrypted through the second connection to the remote web site . . . just like nothing happened (<q>Gibson reaserch Corporation</q>, 2020). Sadly there is no way to prevent SSL interception but there is a way to detect it. How can we detect SSL interception? ITs not as hard as you might think, an SSL proxy doesnt have the private key of the remote server so it is forced to use a different public key which would make it apparent that there is spoofing going on. </p>
