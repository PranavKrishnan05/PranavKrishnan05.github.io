    <p>Members: lilly seeley, shivangi gupta </p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Description:  'Castaway'. Castaway is an app that allows users to create travel plans easily. With castaway, you are provided with travel cost, time, distance, activities, food, and stay on one page. So forget scrambling across dozens of websites, get castaway, a free easy-to-use a trip planner.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: The idea is essentially an app that allows for users to book travel plans in one place but it is extremely similar to websites like Expedia, Trip-advisor, and Trivago. This similarity will make it difficult to outdo such large corporations who already agave a user base of millions who use those websites for all their travel needs. The main issue I have with joining this group is the fact that the problem stated of solving the lack of time to make travel plans has already been solved by these mega-companies and it isn't really a problem anymore so the only way to make a meaningful impact is to make a better website that has a larger user base.</p>

    <p class="tab">Description: For our project, we are planning on inserting RFID scanners into entrances at schools. This will allow schools to scan kids' badges and makes sure people can't enter without the proper identification. Additionally, this will allow schools to not use so many security guards for simple tasks such as this</p>

    <br>
    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: This idea seems like a good concept but the application would be extremely difficult because the RFID would have to identify who has each RFID chip and use facial recognition to identify who is missing theirs. This would not be feasible and would take much more time than we actually have to do this project. I feel the idea is actually good and could be tweaked by using a different method of identifying ids and figuring out who is missing their ID. Using a human is much more efficient for this task, a better way of accomplishing this mission would be to have a scanner that scans IDs at the front door.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: This idea seems like a good concept with how it will interpret all the ingredients you have and calculate what you would be able to make with what you have in your pantry. There are lot of apps that have the exact same purpose and would probably do it better than something we could make in such a small time frame. This also doesnt have an impact that is as influential as an ISP that I would like to join. This issue of not being able to to make things with the ingredients you have isnt very big of an issue and wouldnt seem very impressive to show to colleges or employers.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="tab">Description: Modern AI can accomplish incredible feats such as detecting cancer in patients with DNA information, predicting what advertisements a user is most likely to click on, and generating images based on prompts. Most internet users understand the impressive and growing power of AI, but few understand how AI actually works. Our website will allow users to create their own neural network by specifying its structure, tuning its hyperparameters, and studying the results through performance on popular internet games. For example, a user could create a deep neural network to achieve a high score in Google's Dinosaur Game, using the distance to the nearest obstacle as input and clicks as output. As the network trains, the user will be able to see how the AI improves through the in-game score. The user can also experiment with different AI models (e.g. reinforcement learning and evolutionary) to see which is most effective.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: This is an extremely cool concept in my opionn bvecause it would be able to expose me to creating AI which is something I would like to do. The only reason I didnt want to join this idea was because it didnt seem like something I would want to put on my resume and wouldnt have a practical application. Another issue I had with this Idea was the level of diffucultry it would have to create AI’s for many different games and if we would actually be able to complete this project within the time constraints.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Member(s): Rupak Bhattacharya</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Description: The business plan that I have come up with is an mobile application that would help districts with tutoring. The specific subject I have chosen to assist with is Physics since it is the subject with the lowest passing rate on the AP exam with only 49% of students getting a 3 or higher on the exam. My product will give districts or schools the framework they need to futher assist students pass the AP exam and their own unit exams. The framework will include ways to schedule video tutoring session and add practice questions to prepare students for quizzes.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: This Idea seems like it would benefit high school students but only AP Physics students and it might help but the method that was presented in this proposal doesnt seem very useful to students. Once this application is created it will also may not have that great of an impact on the actual problem of 51% of students failing the exam, it may only help with the learning process but the AP physics test is extremely hard even for the best students. This application could helop people but isnt what I am looking for in an ISP I put this whole school year into.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: The concept could actually benefit a lot of students but the issue with this system is that it would be that they would need the lunch people to receive the orders and place them in a place where around 3000 students would need to pickup. Another issue would be the pickup and students taking others lunches. This idea would also might take longer than the time constraints of this ISP timeline. Overall this idea is very smart but some of these issues would incline me to lean towards my own idea.</p>

    <p class="tab">Description: My proposal is to create an app that tracks school buses. Telling users times of when bus arrival, if its running late, or alterantive bus numbers/times. While being able to expand to multiple districts and even city buses. Problems include collabaration witth school district and secruity concerns</p>

    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: This would be extremely helpful for our school but the district wouldnt allow us the access to live gps of bysses and it could be a security issue of the application isn’t secure. This also doesnt seem like too hard of a task for a large group of CS2 and CS3 students so I believe my time would be better spent on a project that could challenge me a bit more and where I could have more of an impact.</p>

    <p>Decision: Not Joining</p>
    <br>
    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: This concept is pretty shallow and doesnt really solve a real problem that could impact society and even with ads this woulnt really make money. This iudea is also very easy to implement and could be done by one person in a couple weeks and is already available with google. The only unique aspect is randomly choosing a restaurant but anyone could easily make an array with names and just randomize it and spit one out for you to eat at. This idea wouldnt really need me to join considering it already has 3 members and isnt very hard to implement.</p>

    <p class="tab">Analysis/Reason: The website doesnt look presentable so it isnt very easy to read which would be a turn off for potential investors. The idea isnt that bad but I woldn’t trus the product to look good if the presentation isnt very appealing. This idea also has direct competition with google and other search engines so it would be very hard to out do such large corporation.

ShelterSafe aims to eliminate the problem of lack of awareness regarding shelters by prociding a hub that uses GPS signal to locate the user, and then uses cellular data to convey statistics from each nearby shelter concerning food supply, available space, and distance from each shelter. Administrator accounts will be given to non-profits and governments, who can then edit data. Citizens will only have read permissions.</p>
